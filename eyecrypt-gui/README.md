Thank you for downloading EYECRYPT!

To use it, simply run the provided `EYECRYPT.exe` file, and a window should appear.
Select a file to mutate and a file to save the result to.
Optionally, select a key and algorithm to use.
Press `GO!`, and EYECRYPT will mutate the image and save the result to the file you specified.

The key can be a hexadecimal of any length. You can use the random button to generate a random key!
Using the same key and algorithm on the same image and the same output file type should always produce the same result.

For more advanced options, the `Show non-ECB` checkbox will allow you to select from non-ECB encryption algorithms.
