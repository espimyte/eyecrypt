Thank you for downloading EYECRYPT!

---
To use EYECRYPT, simply run `EYECRYPT.exe`.
Select a file and a file to save the result to.
Optionally, select a key and algorithm to use.
Press `GO!`, and EYECRYPT will encrypt the image and save the result to the file you specified.

The key can be a hexadecimal of any length. You can use the random button to generate a random key!
Using the same key and algorithm on the same image and the same output file type should always produce the same result.

For more advanced users, the `Show non-ECB` checkbox will allow you to select from non-ECB encryption algorithms.

NOTE: It is reccomended to use smaller, high contrast images if you wish to see more discernable results. Photos, large images, and/or images with a lot of noise tend to produce more obfuscated results.
